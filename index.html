          <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Sara!</h2>
          <p>Iâ€™m a creative, hands-on communicator who loves to bake, sew, run, and read. My dream job lives at the intersection of environmental communications and data analyticsâ€”Iâ€™m passionate about making complex information accessible and engaging through visual and written storytelling. With a strong interest in environmental justice, I care deeply about the connection between human health and the environment.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Right now, I work as an Executive Assistant at the EPA, where Iâ€™ve developed a knack for balancing administrative precision with creative problem-solving. Iâ€™m looking for a role that blends that organizational strength with bold, editorial storytellingâ€”ideally in the clean energy or climate sector, where I can help shape content that brings big ideas to life.</p>
         <br>
          <p>Outside of work, youâ€™ll probably find me reading a novel, elbows-deep in a sewing project, or driving way too far for a concert!</p>
