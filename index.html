        <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Sara!</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
         Iâ€™m a creative, hands-on communicator passionate about environmental communications and justice. I deeply believe in addressing climate inequity and environmental injustice by disseminating clear, accessible information to the public. My goal is to foster understanding of how environmental and climate change impacts different communities - especially those underserved and disproportionately affected â€” and to advocate for equitable solutions to mitigate these effects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Currently, I work at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as an Assistant to the Office Director in the Office of Resource Management. In this role, I dedicate myself and my team to automating and streamlining processes, driving continuous improvement, and ensuring operational efficiency alongside strategic communication efforts.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My ideal role blends strong organizational skills with bold, editorial storytelling â€” ideally within clean energy, climate, or environmental justice sectors â€” where I can help translate complex data and policy into engaging narratives that inspire meaningful action.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I enjoy baking, sewing, and reading. I am always eager to immerse myself in creative, hands-on projects!

        <p>
          This project utilizes Python to analyze air quality data over time and assess the impact of environmental policies,
          such as the Clean Air Act, on pollution levels. By collecting historical air quality data, conducting statistical analysis,
          and visualizing trends, the project evaluates how different policies have influenced pollution reduction in various regions.
          It also explores the effectiveness of these policies in improving public health, providing actionable insights for future
          policy improvements and enforcement strategies.

          This Power BI project visualizes environmental justice and climate burden across communities using data from the EPAâ€™s
          EJSCREEN and the Justice40 Initiative. It highlights which neighborhoodsâ€”based on income, race, and locationâ€”face the
          greatest environmental risks and overlays this with access to critical resources like healthcare, green space, and clean water.
          The dashboard also tracks federal investment to show where policy funding meets or falls short of Justice40 targets,
          helping identify gaps in enforcement and equity.
