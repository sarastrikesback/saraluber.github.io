        <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Sara!</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a creative, hands-on communicator who loves to bake, sew, run, and read. My dream job lives
          at the intersection of environmental communications and data analyticsâ€”Iâ€™m passionate about making
          complex information accessible and engaging through visual and written storytelling. With a strong
          interest in environmental justice, I care deeply about the connection between human health and the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I work as an Executive Assistant at the EPA, where Iâ€™ve developed a knack for balancing
          administrative precision with creative problem-solving. Iâ€™m looking for a role that blends that
          organizational strength with bold, editorial storytellingâ€”ideally in the clean energy or climate sector,
          where I can help shape content that brings big ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, youâ€™ll probably find me reading a novel, elbows-deep in a sewing project, or driving
          way too far for a concert!

        <h4>Analyzing Air Quality Trends and Policy Impact</h4>
        <p>
          Evaluating the Effectiveness of Environmental Regulations on Pollution Reduction. This project utilizes Python to analyze air quality data over time and assess the impact
          of environmental policies, such as the Clean Air Act, on pollution levels. By collecting historical air quality data, conducting statistical analysis,
          and visualizing trends, the project evaluates how different policies have influenced pollution reduction in various regions. The analysis also explores the effectiveness
          of these policies in improving public health, providing actionable insights for future policy improvements and enforcement strategies.

        <p>
          Visualizing Environmental Risks, Resource Access, and Policy Disparities using EPA EJSCREEN & Justice40 Data. This Power BI project visualizes environmental justice and climate burden
          across communities using data from the EPAâ€™s EJSCREEN and the Justice40 Initiative. It highlights which neighborhoodsâ€”based on income, race, and locationâ€”face the greatest environmental risks
          and overlays this with access to critical resources like healthcare, green space, and clean water. The dashboard also tracks federal investment to show where policy funding meets or falls short
          of Justice40 targets, helping identify gaps in enforcement and equity.
